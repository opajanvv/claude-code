# Project instructions

This repo stores Jan's Claude Code configuration. The root `CLAUDE.md` is the global template that gets symlinked to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

For project-specific instructions, use this file (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`) instead.

## Working on this repo

- The root `CLAUDE.md` should stay generic, usable across all projects
- Commands in `commands/` should be self-contained and documented
- Keep the README focused on setup, not on Claude Code features in general
